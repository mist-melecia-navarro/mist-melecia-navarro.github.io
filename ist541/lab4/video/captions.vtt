00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:03.296
motivational interviewing is this person-centered approach 

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:05.975
for eliciting, a.k.a. drawing out, 

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:07.255
behavior change.

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:09.610
by helping clients to explore and resolve

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:10.501
ambivalence... 

00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:13.447
that feeling of being stuck between a yes and a no.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.641
So in the step of evoking,

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.040
we're getting into their own 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
internal motivations for change.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:19.790
the "why."

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:21.963
We want to reinforce their internal motivations

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.563
to support the overall motivations for change.

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:26.301
We wanna nurture that seed.

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:28.301
So what we're gonna be doing is looking out for

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:29.447
change talk.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.563
Does it sound like they are prepping?

00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:33.307
Maybe they're actually mobilizing?

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:35.927
There's an acronym to help you for this

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:37.240
It's called DARN CAT.

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:38.237
Let's go through it.

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:39.549
Desire.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.050
Ability.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.480
Reasons.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.620
Need.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:45.273
Commitment.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:47.127
Activation.

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:48.827
Taking Steps.
