				<div class="stepTitle">
					 Event 1: Gain Attention
				</div>
				<div class="stepContent">
						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>The first event in Gagné's model is to gain the attention of the learners. This is crucial because it piques their curiosity, captures their interest, and prepares them for the learning experience. The instructor can use various strategies such as storytelling, engaging activities, or thought-provoking questions to grab learners' attention and create a positive learning environment.</p>  <strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Stimulate students with novelty, uncertainty, and surprise</li><li>Pose thought-provoking questions to students</li><li>Have students pose questions to be answered by other students, maybe embedded. (Find Google Jamboard alternative)</li><li>Put them in a story in relation to their academic journey.</li></ul></p>

					 Event 2: State Objectives
				</div>
				<div class="stepContent">
				  <div class="stepDescription">
					<p>Once learners are fully engaged and attentive, it is essential to inform them of the instructional objectives. Clear objectives help learners understand what they will achieve by the end of the instruction. The objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART), providing learners with a sense of purpose and direction throughout the learning process. </p>  <strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Describe required performance</li><li>Describe criteria for standard performance</li><li>Have learners establish criteria for standard performance (<em>"we polled 300 students and students wanted to learn x"</em>)</li>
					  <li>Include course objectives on assessment prompts</li></ul></p>

				  Event 3: Stimulate Recall of Prior Knowledge
			 </div>
				<div class="stepContent">
				  <div class="stepDescription">
					<p>Building upon learners' existing knowledge is an essential step in the learning process. By activating prior knowledge, instructors help learners connect new information with what they already know. This can be achieved through interactive discussions, quizzes, or other activities that prompt learners to recall relevant information, ensuring a solid foundation for the upcoming learning activities. </p>  
					<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Ask questions about previous experiences</li>
					  <li>Ask students about their understanding of previous concepts</li>
					  <li>Relate previous course information to the current topic&nbsp;</li>
					  <li>Have students incorporate prior learning into current activities</li>

			    Event 4: Present the Content&nbsp; </div>
				<div class="stepContent">
						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>Once the learners' prior knowledge has been stimulated, it is time to present the core content or information. The content should be organized logically and presented in a clear and concise manner. Effective presentation methods include lectures, multimedia resources, demonstrations, or interactive simulations. Presenting the content in a structured and learner-focused manner enhances comprehension and retention. </p>  
						<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Present multiple versions of the same content (e.g. video, demonstration, lecture, podcast, group work, etc.), can move from simple to complex</li>
						  <li>Use a variety of media to engage students in learning</li>
						  <li>Incorporate active learning strategies to keep students involved</li>
						  <li>Provide access to content on student portal so students can access it outside of class</li>
						</ul></p>

				<div class="stepTitle">   Event 5: Provide Learner Guidance </div>
				<div class="stepContent"> 						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>Learner guidance refers to providing explicit and meaningful support to learners as they engage with the content. This guidance can take various forms, such as step-by-step instructions, visual cues, examples, or guided practice exercises. By providing necessary support, instructors help learners develop the necessary skills and understanding to achieve the desired learning outcomes. </p>  
						<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Use scaffolding that can be removed slowly as the student learns and masters the task or content &nbsp;</li>
						  <li>Model varied learning strategies: mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing, visualizing</li>
						  <li>Use examples and non-examples – helps see what to do, and what <em>not </em>to do</li>
						  <li>Provide case studies, visual images, analogies, and metaphors – Case studies (real world application), visual images (making associations), and analogies and metaphors (familiar content to help connect with new concepts)</li>

	 <div id="step6">
				<div class="stepTitle"> Event 6: Elicit Performance </div>
				<div class="stepContent"> <div class="stepDescription">
						<p>Eliciting performance involves giving learners the opportunity to practice and apply what they have learned. This active participation helps consolidate knowledge and allows learners to demonstrate their understanding. Instructors can design activities like case studies, group projects, or simulations that simulate real-world situations, enabling learners to transfer their knowledge and skills effectively. </p>  
						<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Facilitate student activities: ask deep-learning questions, have students collaborate with their peers, facilitate practical laboratory exercises</li>
						  <li>Provide formative assessment opportunities: written inputs, individual or group projects, presentations</li>
						  <li>Design effective knowledge checks to demonstrate their comprehension and application of course concepts</li>

	 <div id="step7">
				<div class="stepTitle">
			    Event 7: Provide Feedback </div>
				<div class="stepContent">
						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>Feedback is crucial for learners as it informs them of their progress and provides guidance for improvement. Instructors should provide timely and constructive feedback to help learners understand their strengths and areas for improvement. Feedback can be immediate, in the form of instructor input, or delayed, allowing learners to self-assess their performance. Regardless of the approach, feedback should focus on specific aspects of performance and be aligned with the desired learning outcomes. </p>  
						<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Confirmatory feedback informs the student that they did what they were supposed to do. This type of feedback does not tell the student what she needs to improve, but it encourages the learner.</li>
						  <li>Evaluative feedback apprises the student of the accuracy of their performance or response but does not provide guidance on how to progress.</li>
						  <li>Remedial feedback directs students to find the correct answer but does not provide the correct answer.&nbsp;</li>
						  <li>Descriptive or analytic feedback provides the student with suggestions, directives, and information to help them improve their performance.</li>
						  <li>Peer-evaluation and self-evaluation help learners identify learning gaps and performance shortcomings in their own and peers’ work.</li>

			    Event 8: Assess Performance </div>
				<div class="stepContent">
						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>Assessing learners' performance allows instructors to gauge their level of understanding and mastery of the content. This evaluation can take various forms, such as quizzes, tests, projects, or presentations. Assessments should align with the instructional objectives and provide meaningful insights into learners' progress. By assessing performance, instructors can identify areas for further learning and provide additional support if needed. </p>  
						<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Administer pre- and post-tests to check for progression of competency in content or skills</li>
						  <li>Embed formative assessment opportunities throughout instruction using oral questioning, short active learning activities, or quizzes</li>
						  <li>Implement a variety of assessment methods to provide students with multiple opportunities to demonstrate proficiency&nbsp;</li>

				<div class="stepTitle"> 			    Event 9: Enhance Retention &amp; Transfer</div>
				<div class="stepContent">
						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>The final event focuses on enhancing retention and transfer of learning. Instructors can employ strategies such as summarizing key points, providing mnemonic devices, or encouraging learners to apply their knowledge in different contexts. By reinforcing what has been learned and promoting transferability, instructors ensure that learners can apply their knowledge and skills in real-life situations. </p>  
						<strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Avoid isolating course content. Associate course concepts with prior (and future) concepts and build upon prior (and preview future) learning to reinforce connections.</li>
						  <li>Continually incorporate questions from previous tests in subsequent examinations to reinforce course information.</li>
						  <li>Have students convert information learned in one format into another format (e.g. verbal or visuospatial). For instance, requiring students to create a concept map to represent connections between ideas (Halpern &amp; Hakel, 2003, p. 39).&nbsp;</li>
						  <li>To promote deep learning, clearly articulate your lesson goals, use your specific goals to guide your instructional design, and align learning activities to lesson goals (Halpern &amp; Hakel, 2003, p. 41).</li>
