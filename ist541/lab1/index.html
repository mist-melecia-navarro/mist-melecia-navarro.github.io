      	 	<h1> How to Design With Gagne's Nine Events </h1>    
     	 	 <h2> By  Melecia Navarro </h2>  <br>
			<h4>By following Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction, you can create effective learning experiences that engage learners, facilitate comprehension, and promote long-term retention. This model provides a systematic approach to instructional design, ensuring that each event is carefully considered and implemented to maximize learning outcomes.</h4><br>

					 Event 1: Gain Attention
				</div>

				<div class="stepContent">

						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>The first event in Gagné's model is to gain the attention of the learners. This is crucial because it piques their curiosity, captures their interest, and prepares them for the learning experience. The instructor can use various strategies such as storytelling, engaging activities, or thought-provoking questions to grab learners' attention and create a positive learning environment.</p>  <strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Stimulate students with novelty, uncertainty, and surprise</li><li>Pose thought-provoking questions to students</li><li>Have students pose questions to be answered by other students, maybe embedded. (Find Google Jamboard alternative)</li><li>Put them in a story in relation to their academic journey.</li></ul></p>

					 Event 2: State Objectives
				</div>

				<div class="stepContent">

						<div class="stepDescription">
						<p>Once learners are fully engaged and attentive, it is essential to inform them of the instructional objectives. Clear objectives help learners understand what they will achieve by the end of the instruction. The objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART), providing learners with a sense of purpose and direction throughout the learning process. </p>  <strong>Methods:</strong><ul><li>Describe required performance</li><li>Describe criteria for standard performance</li><li>Have learners establish criteria for standard performance (we polled 300 students and students wanted to learn x)</li><li>Include course objectives on assessment prompts</li></ul></p>
